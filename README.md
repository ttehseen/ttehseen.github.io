Yale-NUS College (YNC) has a very busy work culture that places a lot of importance on learning. Like any college's student, one of the biggest decisions that YNC students take every semester is choosing classes for next semester. However, no streamlined vessel exists with all the information they would need to inform this decision. One Wordpress microsite exists that has, among others, issues with updating and security. This project reworks this microsite, keeping its original name #YNC Coursemate#. This new web application aims to provide a consolidated platform that serves the needs of the student population by providing an intuitive, exhaustive, aesthetic and modern platform for course and instructor evaluations. 

 

# **Iterations:**

 


## Initial Coursemate microsite:
In essence, the earliest inspiration for the prototype was the current microsite. It provided a basis for me to draw further ideas from. YNC Coursemate is a Wordpress microsite that stores student submitted evaluations on courses and professors. The website did not contain all the information users would need. For instance, there was no contact information about the instructors or any information about students who had taken these classes earlier. Additionally, it was not updated regularly and was generally unpopular among students. Aesthetically speaking, the colors used for the website were headache inducing albeit full of school spirit.



## Low Fidelity Paper Prototype (Previously submitted):
The earliest prototype was a set of hand-drawn interactive illustrations of the potential layout of the reworked website. Interest for a reworked platform was gathered through a questionnaire and focused interviews. In addition, these helped collect data on the potential features users would want in such a reboot. A paper prototype and report were then generated to display these features in an interactive manner. They included a homepage with search bars to search for professors and courses, a notifications and messages section, as well as sample evaluation pages for professors and courses with their student submitted reviews and lists of past students among other things. The prototype could be ‘tested’ using its various stapled parts that emulated popup windows. However, it was hard for users who tested the paper prototype to fully visualize it as a digital website.

## Digital Wireframes (Previously submitted):
Alongside the paper prototype, some digital prototypes were also drawn up with the help of Photoshop. The primary purpose for these was to help visualize how the digital platform would look like to students that I interviewed for feedback on the erstwhile mentioned paper prototype.



## High-fidelity Prototype:
The Paper Prototype and Digital Wireframes were then presented to potential users in the Yale-NUS community and their feedback was noted. At this point, the interviews conducted were short to ensure the project is on the right track. The features were shared with them and criticisms noted. However, I expected to see all 8 individuals a second time after the High Fidelity Prototype was created to get better insight.
The process of converting the paper-based concept to a semi-interactive static webpage was not very simple. The general layout remained consistent but crucial details such as choice of color, font, images, design of the logo required a great deal of thought.

## Final Iteration:



 

 

# **Changes made between prototypes:**

 

## Removal of messaging option

 

In both the paper prototype and the initial versions of the high fidelity prototype, there was an option to click on past students’ hyperlinked names in the respective course/professor evaluation pages and send them a message to request more information. The intended recipient would get a notification on their homepage that they could open to view the message and reply accordingly. 

 

After reevaluation and deliberation with interviewees, the messaging option was removed and was replaced by a mailto hyperlink that would begin composing an email to the student instead. There were a couple of reasons for this change:

 

   1. The student evaluation platform is intended to be a platform that is used only seasonally by students. The interviewed students said they would each it an average of 2.3 times per semester. Thus, it did not make a lot of sense to have a messaging option in the platform since users will not probably read it until months later. When given the option of receiving an email notification when a message is received in Coursemate, as in Canvas, most replied that just having an email sent directly would be a better alternative. The lesser the amount of links they have to click the better.
   2. 7 out of 8 users said that they strongly preferred and were likelier to respond to. an email than a message on another platform like Coursemate.

 

## Getting rid of multiple pages.

The initial prototype was designed to have a hierarchy of pages and popups. When you searched for a course or professor, you would be taken to the evaluation page where information would be categorized into different pages and popup windows. In order to write a new review, for instance, you would have to open a new page. In order to write a comment, you have to deal with a new popup window. This was forgiven for a flatter structure where you could access all your information from one page. When reminded of the inconveniences of an information overload, the interviewees said that while they recognize that having all the information on one page could be an information overload, it is a tradeoff that they are willing to make because:

 

   1. The data presented is a mix of textual and visual which makes it easy to digest. If the reviews were all plain text it would have been a problem having everything on one page.

   2. The seasonal usage of the website means that users want as much information as they can with limited navigation. If the website were one that they used regularly then they would go for greater hierarchy but for a website like Coursemate that would only experience seasonal usage, they preferred having a flat hierarchy. 

 

## Getting rid of syllabi and course material from the website.

Another major change to the website was the omission of certain materials from the website. Six out of Eight people interviewed felt that the syllabi and the course materials should be removed. The reasons were as follows:

 

   1. As opposed to a CV, a course syllabus or reading list does not get updated very often in the same web address. For instance, for the CV, the Coursemate website links the user to the YNC website where the CV is uploaded and regularly updated on the same link. However, syllabi tend to change every year and are only added to new webpages on Canvas. Updating these links every year would be a huge hassle. There is a risk of this material getting outdated. The users preferred getting syllabi directly from instructors.

   2. There would be concerns of intellectual property right issues. The website will have to get written permission from every professor for using their syllabi/readings lists because these fall under the domain of intellectual property. CVs, on the other hand, are already on a public platform and don't face the same problem.

 

## Adding instructions to make the website easier to use. 

Users felt that the current website can be a bit complicated to navigate for users. To this effect, three major changes were proposed out of which the third one was eventually chosen:

 

   1. Have instructions printed at each step to tell users what to do.

   2. Replacing the help section on the homepage to an FAQ section where users can learn about the purpose of the website and instructions on how to navigate it.

   3. Running a small demo when the user logs in for the first few times to acquaint him with the system. There will be an option to turn off the demo for next time onwards.

 

## Annotating sliders.

Many users felt that the sliders, in the earlier prototypes, were very confusing. Firstly, it was not entirely clear what each attribute meant. For instance, what does friendliness mean? Secondly, when using the sliders, they did not get a sense of the scale that was represented by the slider. Did a slider all the way to the right mean friendly or not friendly? And what decides the degree of friendliness. I noticed this flaw and expected vast inconsistencies in the data collected by such sliders because individual responses would be heavily skewed by their own ideas of what each attribute meant. Thus, in order to standardize the reviews, the slider bars were annotated at the extremes to give the users a similar sense of scale.

 

 

 

# **Prototype Implementation:**

 

By the end of this project, I aim to have a functional front end that can be implemented readily. This includes all the prototypes and design outlines. As stated earlier, the effectiveness of the project rests on its usability and exhaustiveness in providing information to the users. Thus, throughout the course of the project feedback was collected periodically from users to keep it on the right track. 

 

Throughout the process, inspiration was drawn from many existing applications such as Facebook, Rate my Professor etc. For the course evaluation pages, inspiration was taken from CVs and their simplicity in containing information.

## Problems:

 

### Lack of knowledge about web development.

When I undertook this project, I knew I was going to face a lot of trouble trying to build the front end of a website with no knowledge of basic web development. For the first prototype, I was able to use paper to display my ideas without any coding. For this prototype, too, I considered using Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop for the time being but I realized that I would eventually need a working front end anyways, so I decided to dedicate time to learning the necessary tools i.e. some basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript. YouTube was a great resource and so wasw3schools.com. I looked at examples online and tried to make sense of it. Once got around to using HTML, I needed to set up a local host to run my webpages, so I could test them periodically. In addition, I found a tutorial online that taught how to create static webpages with a local host using Eclipse. Since I was well acquainted with Eclipse, I started working on it.

 

###    Scaling.

One thing that I realized straightaway was that since I was developing the website on my laptop, I did not take into consideration the fact that screen sizes could differ on the devices that would visit the website. This became apparent when I exported my project to one of the computers in the computer lab. Not only did many of the fonts not render, the website was completely thrown off in terms of spatial arrangement on the screen. Since the computer did not have the IDE that I was using on my laptop to edit the code, I ended up correcting the issue on my own laptop. It turns out that I had stuck to using pixel sizes in order to arrange components on the screen. Switching to percentage figures not only did make the website zoom-able, but it also was able to cater to screens of different sizes that could be used to view it.

 

###    Aesthetics.

Another big challenge that I faced was selecting the fonts and colors for the website. Being a student myself I thought I would be able to make a reasonable choice on my own for a website designed primarily for students. The colors had to be simple and elegant. However, at the same time they could not be monotonous. Since I was going to cater to a diverse population, my choice of color had to be one that was mutually considered good. However, I would keep running into an awkward looking sentence or a button that looked too gaudy. Feedback was also not very helpful. For instance, many of my interviewees just used phrases like nice, this doesn't feel right etc. when commenting on the aesthetic which were not particularly useful. 

 

The basic idea that I had on mind was to keep the colors a bit on the dull side. The exception for this was the logo, which used orange and blue- Yale-NUS colors. The primary color was teal, and the secondary color was grey. Text was white on teal or black on grey/white. These colors are sufficiently distinguishable from each other without being too saturated. Since I anticipated anxious college students running through the website minutes before course selection deadlines, I wanted the website to be as easy on the eye as possible. Headaches could be prevented.

 

Once the primary color was selected, I knew I needed different shades of it to use for text boxes, mouse hovers etc. Therefore, I used Google's Material.io to find three different shades that I could use on the website. These were also web-friendly and capable of being displayed on a plethora of different platforms. 

 

The choice for font was also a bit tricky. I knew Serif fonts would be a bad idea since they were not well-known for readability on a screen. In addition, most of these fonts were not very aesthetic to look at. Within the Sans Serif fonts I was looking at Helvetica, Arial, Avenir and Muli. Eventually, I ended up choosing Helvetica for the titles and Arial for text bodies. The choice was made on the fact that in addition to looking nice, these fonts were readily supported by most browsers. Owing to the range of devices Yale-NUS students use to access the internet, Helvetica and Arial seemed to be good choices. The last thing I wanted was a Yale-NUS student frustrated that his Opera mini was not loading any course reviews. 

 

Great care was taken to make the website symmetric. Symmetry, often found in nature, evokes a sense of balance, harmony and order. The look and feel are soothing, something one would like to instill in stressed college students. Text was justified where possible, and the evaluation pages were divided into two sections with separate containers for each piece of information in order to make grasping information quick and effective. 

 

 

# **Prototype  Current Version:**

 

These are the key features of the application. The ones with a (*) next to them have not been fully implemented because they came in late during. Most of these have been mentioned in earlier sections, so this section will serve to compile the key features of this system:

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Secure Login*                  | Screen to login users to the website. Only accessible by Yale-NUS students. |
| *Notification handling*         | A  notification system to update users if their reviews are up-voted/commented upon. |
| *Repository of course reviews* | A list of course reviews that are ordered  based on their age and amounts of up-votes alongside an aggregate score for the reviewed course/Professor. |
| *Course review submission*      | Option to submit a new review for a Professor/Course.       |
| *Interaction with content*      | Option to send an email to past student of  the course Option to add comments to the review page for potential reviewers to check. |
| *First time tutorial\**         | A  one-time start-up wizard that guides you through the website and gives instructions on how to use the website. |
| *Editable content\**            | Being able to edit reviews to answer specific needs.        |

 

 

 

 

 

 

###    Login, security.

The homepage is very minimalistic, in line with other Yale-NUS Websites such as OurCors, displaying a YNC Coursemate logo. When the Log-in button is clicked, a popup window opens that prompts you to enter your log-in details. Clicking outside the popup window closes it.

 

The user inputs his Yale-NUS email and password and is allowed to proceed to the next page. A _Remember me_ checkbox makes sure that login details and profile picture are stored for later. Do note that only Yale-NUS community members are allowed access to the website. Any outside account will be rejected by the system. All Yale-NUS community members can log in using their regular account details that they use to log in to other campus services. 

In an earlier iteration, there was an option to sign up for the website or login using social media as well. This was dropped in the final iteration since having to create yet another account might be a disincentive for many students. Similarly, connecting via Facebook would not be advisable as Facebook profiles generally do not have work/school emails associated with them.

Once the user successfully logs in, he lands on a homepage that has his name, class year and academic major displayed. On the homepage, he also finds two search boxes to look up a course or professor respectively. Depending on the major of the user, the search boxes display the top three instructors or courses to choose from. If the user wants to get information about some other instructor or course, he can type in the name and suggestions will start appearing. Upon clicking the search result, he will be redirected to the relevant page. In this case, it will be Professor Perrault's page.

 

 

###   Relevant materials about the courses.

Each instructor currently teaching at Yale-NUS and every course that is being offered or has been offered in the past will have a page dedicated to them. These pages will have a plethora of features available on them. An instructor's page has the following information:

   1. Name and picture:

Full picture and name of the instructor, including any adopted aliases to aid searchability.

   2. Contact Information:

Email address of the instructor and work phone number (if provided).

   3. CV:

Link to an externally hosted CV. Instead of storing the CV locally, it is better to link an external document that is expected to be updated regularly. A good source is the Yale-NUS website where CVs are generally up to date. Another option is the instructor's personal website if it exists.

   4. Office Address and availability information.

Updated location of offices within each RC as well as the office hours of the Professor.

   5. List of current and past courses

A list of current and past courses that have been offered before. Initially, it was suggested to include only current courses to avoid redundancy, but users felt that a complete list is necessary so that they can make decisions about courses they intend to take in the future that are not being offered at the moment.

   6. List of past students

A list of students that consent to have their names displayed on the course page. These names will be linked to their email addresses so clicking on the name will open your email client. This will serve to allow users to contact their peers for further information.

  7. List of user-submitted reviews.

  8. These reviews will exist with _upvotes_ from other users sorted according to date and number of upvotes. The subject of each review will be a list of adjectives used in the review. This provides a snapshot of the review that the user can use to decide if he wants to read or not. For instance, if I am looking for critical reviews of a professor, then I will look for negative adjectives in the subject line. 

 
  9. Aggregates

The scores from each submitted review are aggregated and displayed on the left side of the page. There are individual aggregates as well as an overall numerical aggregate. 

 

 

### Submitting a new review.


Users can also submit a new review for a course/instructor. There is a section in the bottom right hand corner of the website for that purpose. Users first rate the course/instructor based on the attributes using a slider scale. The slider is marked on both ends to make clear what the user is rating. After he's done with the sliders, the user moves on to writing a review in the text box below. When he is satisfied with his review, he can click the submit button. At this point, the review gets added to the list of reviews on the page and the user's submitted ratings are aggregated with the averages displayed on the page.

 

### Interaction with available information.
 

Users will be able to interact with the evaluation pages in order to get more information. For instance, clicking on the email address of the instructor or on any of the names in the _Past students_ list will open up an email client ready to send an email. 
 

In addition, clicking on a course title would open the evaluation page of that course. Since I have not  prototyped a course page yet, I will not put a screenshot of this event. However, I will stress how important the option to go from one evaluation page to another is for the interactivity of the system.

 

A third way users can interact with the system is by _upvoting_ reviews. Similar to the _like_ feature on Facebook, the upvote is a good way of showing agreement or support of a review. Users can judge the reliability of a review from the number of upvotes it gets. On the other hand, a particularly useful review can be upvoted many times which will bump it up in the list.



Finally, users can also leave comments on the evaluation pages themselves. For instance, if a user feels like a particular piece of information is not answered by any of the reviews, he can enter a comment that will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Everyone who has reviewed will be notified of the comment in the website.

 


##    Notifications:


The platform will also have a notification feature that
notifies users whenever there are new upvotes on their review or new comments
on an evaluation page they have reviewed in. Clicking on the notification will take them to the page the notification is coming from. These notifications will not be delivered to the email address associated with the account; they will be kept within the app.

 

## Unimplemented features:


###    First-time tutorial:

One feature that I, and the interviewees, identified as crucial but have not implemented yet is a tutorial feature that acquaints you with the system when you log in for the first time. It will be essentially a wizard that guides you through each feature of the website such as searching for an instructor, creating a new review etc. The user will have the option to disable the tutorial after he is confident that he knows how to use the website. 

###    Make reviews editable:

Another feature that I would like to see implemented in a future iteration is the ability to edit reviews retroactively. In addition to allow room for rectification of errors in typing, it also lets users update their reviews in light of recent comments. If someone posts a comment on the website asking fora specific detail that a review has missed, the user can go and edit his comment to add that bit of detail.

# **Prototype Evaluation:**

 

## Method:


Since the problem that I am trying to solve with this system is a very common one faced by the student of Yale-NUS, feedback from these very students has been crucial for the health of this project. In contrast with the previous iteration, the feedback required for this iteration was mostly qualitative. In essence, I wished to see how users interacted with/reacted to the high-fidelity prototype through focus interviews. Users were first shown the low fidelity prototype after its completion and given a brief on what the vision for the high-fidelity prototype would be. Their feedback was considered while drawing up the high-fidelity prototype but most comments were inconclusive since there was no actual computer-based testable prototype. In the next few weeks the high-fidelity prototype was drawn up and these users were invited to try it and their suggestions were audio-recorded. The following users were interviewed in the second round. Returning interviewees are marked with a (*). _The transcription of each individual interview is attached in the Appendix_.

 

| **Student**               | **Class/Major** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Francesca  Maviglia\*** | 2019/PPE        | Diligent  student who looks up/researches classes and professors weeks in advance before  the round opens. Actively looks out for as much information as possible. |
| **Pragya  Sethi\***       | 2018/PPE        | Spontaneous student who will take  classes because they sound interesting. Trusts her gut instinct more than  other peoples' opinions. Would give a new Professor a try before deciding  against taking his class. |
| **Angad  Srivastava\***   | 2017/Psychology | Sophomore  who is not entirely sure about his academic trajectory in terms of what  courses to take. Regularly consults peers to see how they are managing  courses. |
| **Vrinda  Sood\***        | 2020/PPE        | True liberal arts student with  varied interest. Likes to dabble in multiple disciplines and seeks advice  from seniors regularly. |
| **Aditi  Kothari**        | 2019/Economics  | Junior  who is almost done with her major requirements. Taking classes for fun now.  Will continue experimenting. |
| **Nitya  Sriram**         | 2020/MCS        | Sophomore following a typical MCS  pathway.                  |
| **Pratyush  More**        | 2018/MCS        | Senior  who is almost done with college so is a great authority on student matters  esp. when it comes to course selection. |
| **Adarsh  Puri\***        | 2021/Undeclared | Clueless freshman.                                           |

 

Additionally, a series of 15informal interviews were conducted in the Yale-NUS library. Passers-by were requested to have a look at the prototype at various stages of completion and give feedback on it.

 

## Results:

 

Overall feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Users seemed to be more excited about the Project than myself. Some of them saw no room for improvement. Others made some extremely valid points, most of which I have talked about in detail in earlier sections and thus will not reiterate to avoid repetition.  Since many of these comments came on a rolling basis, they were used to improve the application over the weeks. However, there are still some suggestions that are yet to be mentioned and taken into consideration.

For instance, some students suggested using more universally recognized attributes for the reviews; ones that can be easily qualified such as tardiness of the professor, or charisma. Another student suggested having the final grade reported at the end of each review in order to judge the reliability of the review. 

However, some users raised questions about the running of the App. They felt that while the app seemed intuitive and useful, it would require to be updated regularly. Some of the primary concerns they had was that reviews could get out of date quickly, there was a risk of spam/improper usage by students protected by the anonymity and the risk of non-Yale-NUS students gaining access to the website which could raise privacy concerns over material shared such as syllabi. While I noted that these questions lay outside my area of concern, I do recognize their importance especially if I am to take this project further after DIS is over. I think a good solution to these issues is to have Registry manage the website. Since they have the relevant resources and authority for the job, the risk of material getting outdated or unwanted visitors accessing sensitive information can be minimized. In addition, Registry can also contribute to the content by sharing some of the year-end reviews that they collect from students. It must be noted that some students were not entirely satisfied with a school body regulating the platform since that can lead to potential vetting of comments which they would not appreciate. This sentiment seems to be true especially recently with the atmosphere of distrust that has clouded the campus in recent weeks.


Another concern that they raised was of non-usage. Many students felt that, as is with many ideas that look great on paper, in reality the penetration rate of the app could be very low. They mentioned the failure of similar apps in the past such as the YNC Guidebook that saw extremely minimal usage. Since the app's success is contingent upon students submitting reviews, low usage would severely decrease its value and usefulness. One possible improvement is to have the app advertised by students on noticeboards and in elevators. Professors could also encourage its usage before the start of the course registration period and Registry could include a link in the module brief it releases every semester. The more students know about the app, the higher would be its usage.

 

 

 

# **Conclusion**

 

This project has made me realize the sheer amount of details and care that goes into designing interactive systems. From gathering data about a problem that the system intends to solve, to getting input from the potential users to draw out possible features and to finally implementing these features and further fine tuning to produce the best possible and most effective version of the system. The class prepared me well for the task at hand as I was able to easily identify which features would work well with users and was able to back it up by both qualitative and quantitative research. I now look to see this project to fruition and come up with a fully-fledged program that can candle the needs of this community.
